Part of my coursework in Design Patterns 

Problem Statement : 

Company Movie4U has a movie theater with five halls in it. All these halls are of the same size
and even have the same number of seats, fifty-two. The seats are of two different types though,
regular seats and priority seats, super comfortable recliners at the center of a hall. Each week
the theater shows five new movies. Each of the movies of the week is assigned to only one hall
and is shown at a certain time according to a schedule. The schedule for a movie is pretty
simple and is generated automatically based on its length: a movie is shown for the whole day
from 10am to 10pm with 2 hours pause in between. Each week a manager of the theater comes
up with a new list of movies and only he/she is allowed to enter it to the system. Movies of the
week are all in different genres which can be Action Movie, Comedy, Drama, Horror and Thriller.
To sell movie tickets to customers, the movie theater has one hardworking salesperson from
whom the customers are buying tickets. The company divides its customers into two categories:
- regular, ordinary customer without any benefits and privileges from the theater - member, a
customer who has membership in Movie4UClub. Unlike regular customers, members of the
Movie4UClub have several benefits and privileges: - with each purchase of the movie ticket a
member of the club receives 10 points which can be collected throughout the year and then
redeemed for a movie ticket. - - only members can buy priority seats in the movie halls.
members are allowed to return their ticket and receive a full refund To become a member of the
Movie4UClub a regular customer has to buy a membership from the theater and get hold of
membership card. The membership is valid for the next 12 months from the day of purchase
and has to be renewed explicitly upon expiration. The purpose of the project is to write an
application for the salesperson of the movie theater so he/she can sell tickets, register regular
customers, register members of the Movie4UClub, keep track of sold/unsold seats and member
points as well as perform refund operation if a member wishes to return a movie ticket. The
application should also allow the manager to add movies to the movies of the week list and
assign them to the halls.

We are assigned the task to prepare 10 different UML Digrams for the above mentioned scenario.

The UML Diagrams to be drafted are:

1.Use-Case Diagram
2.Class Diagram
3.Object Diagram
4.Sequence Diagram
5.Activity Diagram
6.Activity Diagram with SwimLane
7.Component Diagram
8.Collaboration Diagram
9.Deployment Diagram
10.Statechart/State-Machine Diagram
